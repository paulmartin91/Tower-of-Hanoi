<h1>Tower of Hanoi</h1>
<p>The classic game made using CSS flexboxes
<br>
<sub><i>Coded from scratch by Paul Martin using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</i></sub>
</p>
<h2>A few notes...</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Move the Tower!</b> - The aim of the game is to move the tower from the leftmost peg to the rightmost peg, one brick at a time, without placing a larger brick on top of a smaller one</li>
<li><b>8 levels</b> - Each with another brick to stack</li>
<li><b>Move counter</b> - There is a move counter in the description section, along with a minimum number of moves for each level. See if you can find the most efficiant way to complete each level!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>So please enjoy and let me know what you think, or if you come across any bugs!</p>
